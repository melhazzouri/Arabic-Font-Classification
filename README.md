# Arabic Font Classification
In recent times, the identification of Arabic fonts has become increasingly significant, primarily because of its wide-ranging applications in various fields. The primary focus of this study centers around the recognition aspect of Arabic fonts, which poses significant challenges, notably the vast diversity present within the fonts utilized in the Arabic language.  A Convolutional neural network (CNN) was built to classify between Arabic fonts with 95% accuracy.

# Dataset

RuFa (Ruqaa-Farsi) dataset contains images of text written in one of two Arabic fonts: Ruqaa and Nastaliq (Farsi). The dataset contains 40,000 synthesized images and 516 real ones, 40,516 in total. Images are in RGB JPG format at 100Ã—100px. Text in the images has a varying number of words, position, size, and opacity.
